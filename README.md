TBW

## What do I need?
Before cloning this repo, I recommend installing the following software:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= `24.4.0` to install packages.
- A [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) on your local machine or in a cloud service.

## Setup
After cloning the repo, install the Node packages in the project's root directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/moviegraphy.git
cd moviegraphy
npm run setup
```

Lastly, create an `.env` file at your project's root with the following content.
```env
TBW
```

## How to run it
To run it, simply execute
```sh
npm start
```
In case you want to execute it as a single instance (using a production-like build)
```sh
npm start:prod
```

## Folder structure
In case you have cloned the repo, it will show you the following folders:
- `.github:` [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions/) files used to run post-merge commits like unit test coverage collection.
- `.husky:` Dedicated to [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) configuration files.
- `configs:` Location of several tools configuration files for better organization.
- `src:` Location of all used components partially following Astro guidance:
  - `assets:` SVG files for specific purposes.
  - `components:` Location of the used components, all based on React and TypeScript.
    - Those are separated by entity/feature usage, and the `/shaded` are the base ones to be reused on other implementations.
  - `islands:` Astro components used as reusable sections on any page.
  - `layouts:` User interfaces used to wrap the Astro pages in a common structure.
  - `pages:` Astro-specific pages that also work as routes.
  - `store:` Global-level data handling using nanostructures to handle common data through Astro and React components.
- `prisma:` Location of prisma implementation with its `models/entities` and migrations to mirror the entity relationships in the database.
- `store:` Global-level data handling using nanostructures to handle common data through Astro and React components.
- `ts`: Location of shared pieces of reusable code such as functions and TypeScript types

## Branches and Environments
After my previous experience with [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) in [other projects](https://github.com/NicolasOmar/reactive-bulma/issues/3), I decided to give the following meaning to the project's versions after `v4.0.0`:
- Major versions (`5.0.0`, `6.0.0`, and beyond) will refer to milestone achievements and significant changes that will need extra attention before the update.
- Minor versions (`4.1.0`, `4.2.0`, and so on) will refer to bug fixes that required several important code changes or specific new features.
- Patch versions (`4.0.1`, `4.0.2`, and so on) will refer to bug fixes that required small code changes or weekly dependency updates.

To check the current project's status, go to the [Roadmap](#roadmap) section.

### Branching

Given the mentioned release logic, `main` is the only static branch, and each developed feature or fix will have a unique branch with its PR and a merge commit following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and [semantic commits](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format) specifications.

## Roadmap
The first version/release ([`v1.0`](https://github.com/NicolasOmar/moviegraphy/milestone/1)) was created to investigate, pick, and integrate several libraries as project technical foundations, which took the shape of a proof of concept that you can review [here](localhost).
